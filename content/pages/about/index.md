I'm currently being introduced to the kernel graphics stack by my
mentors, [Rodrigo Siqueira](https://siqueira.tech/), [Melissa
Web](https://melissawen.github.io/) and [André
Almeida](https://andrealmeid.com/) (check them out!)

I currently study at Universidade de São Paulo (USP), and you can check out my
CV [over here](/CV.pdf).

Some cool facts about me:

* I love weird music!

    My usual mantra is that if it has more than 100k monthly listeners, it's
    too mainstream...
* I really like skateboarding, calligraphy, and pottery, too!

    I just didn't say I'm good at any of them
* I also like cats a lot but I'm a little allergic to them :(

    I'm working on that, though :)
* I'm from a **cold mountain town** in the countryside of Rio de Janeiro

    Surprise: not everywhere in Rio is hot! Or sunny!

    We don't even have beaches, how absurd!
