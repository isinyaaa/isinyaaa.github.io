Hiya! I'm Isabella Basso, a 22yo Brazilian girl who's really into low-level stuff. I'm currently being introduced to the kernel graphics stack by my mentors, [Rodrigo Siqueira](https://siqueira.tech/), [Melissa Web](meow) and [André Almeida](auau) (check them out!)

I currently study at Universidade de São Paulo (USP), and you can check out my CV [over here](/CV.pdf).

> In case you're looking for it: here's the [RSS feed for this site](/rss.xml).

Some cool facts about me:

* I love weird music!

    Currently listening to a lot of breakcore
* I really like skateboarding, too!

    That's what spending an awful amount of time in front a screen did to me in 2021…
* I also like cats a lot but am allergic to them :(

    I'm working on that, though!
* I'm from a **cold mountain town** in the countryside of Rio de Janeiro

    Surprise: not everywhere in Rio is hot! Or sunny!

    We don't even have beaches, hahaha

    It feels a lot like some English town (if you've ever been there).
* I mainly chose to go to USP (over other Brazilian unis) because of its _campus_

    I find the main _campus_ on the city of São Paulo itself **really** nice, and this has played a huge factor for me staying there

    Of course it being a really well ranked uni was also a pretty important factor, but there are others like this
