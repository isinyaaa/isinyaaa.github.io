        <div class="post-content">
            <p>Alright, so you came for another one of Isinya‚Äôs soap operas! I‚Äôm excited to
have you here, stranger :)</p>
<p>Today, let‚Äôs <strong>not</strong> talk about the kernel, instead, I want to help you
understand how <strong>you</strong> can be part of open source communities.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span><h2 id="context">Context<a class="zola-anchor" href="#context" aria-label="Anchor link for: context">‚åó</a></h2>
<p>So, before I was here lecturing you on the kernel, I was just your average Arch
user: system broke, fixed system, me happy. But (maybe) with a twist, in that I
eventually started enjoying having it broken, and who doesn‚Äôt! I mean‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs
only a problem when you have that assignment for tomorrow afternoon and your
machine just won‚Äôt boot up üò¢. But you can learn a lot from an experience like
this, so I think it ends up being pretty interesting in the end!</p>
<p>After I started working as a developer, I learned that I wasn‚Äôt as bad at
coding as I once thought, so I started piecing a lot of these experiences
together and came to the conclusion that, you know‚Ä¶ Python development is okay
and all, but after you‚Äôve done plenty with a high-level language like this, at
least for me, it got <em>pretty boring</em> (to put it mildly).</p>
<p>Then I went on a journey looking for <strong>something</strong> that might give me that
feeling that you‚Äôre doing something <em>cool</em> ‚Äì of course I‚Äôm oversimplifying
things, but this isn‚Äôt too far off reality, to be honest. At first, I was
thinking about something related to game development, in C++ maybe, or even
someplace to exercise my algorithmic skills (and please, do have a look at
<a href="https://projecteuler.net/">project Euler</a> if that‚Äôs your thing!) but again and
again I kept having that hollow-ish feeling, because those projects aren‚Äôt
<strong>that</strong> useful (practically speaking, that is), and then it all feels like a
hobby, which isn‚Äôt exactly the best thing when you‚Äôre really busy. In short, I
felt like I was <strong>wasting time</strong>. I ended up with one conclusion though: that
maybe what I wanted after all was to contribute to something <strong>real</strong>, and by
that I mean a <em>real open source project</em>, that people use and contribute to and
that can <strong>help you</strong> truly.</p>
<p>But then there‚Äôs a huge question that pops up right in front of you:</p>
<h2 id="how-to-start-contributing-to-open-source">How to start contributing to open-source?<a class="zola-anchor" href="#how-to-start-contributing-to-open-source" aria-label="Anchor link for: how-to-start-contributing-to-open-source">‚åó</a></h2>
<p>Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt think I can answer that once and for all‚Ä¶ I mean, it‚Äôs
not the same for everybody: you may be interested in data science or quantum
computing (both of which I know nothing about!). And the processes for
contributing might be radically different as well. But then I can tell you
<em>how</em> to look for something to start contributing, and then someone in that
field can help you.</p>
<h3 id="looking-for-a-project">Looking for a project<a class="zola-anchor" href="#looking-for-a-project" aria-label="Anchor link for: looking-for-a-project">‚åó</a></h3>
<p>Just looking up projects on GitHub can get pretty boring pretty soon, so I
suggest you look for an organisation that makes projects you look up to
(personal examples: <a href="https://github.com/llvm">llvm</a>,
rust projects like <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs">this one</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup">Khronos Group</a>, etc‚Ä¶), and try to find
someone that is accessible in there. I, for example, talked with a couple guys
from Google and even a girl from Collabora but actually a really nice place to
look for those people, again, is in your local community!</p>
<p>Try to speak with your peers or others who might know a project that needs some
love, maybe even a project of their own, or they might know someone close by
who might be able to help you directly (that‚Äôs how I met my mentor)!</p>
<p>To be honest the biggest barrier in these cases (apart from taking the first
step) is the language barrier. But if you read it up to here I think you are
fit for the job :).</p>
<h3 id="learning-the-basics">Learning the basics<a class="zola-anchor" href="#learning-the-basics" aria-label="Anchor link for: learning-the-basics">‚åó</a></h3>
<p>But then you might run into the same problem I did: you‚Äôre not sure how you can
learn all those cool things, and it seems sooo overwhelming, because usually
there is no clear path to learn it all.</p>
<p>Well, for that you‚Äôre gonna have to face the facts: People build their
expertise with time, and if you keep that in mind you might be able to overcome
those fears! I have a little mantra of mine as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You just have to learn the basics üòå</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anything you learn at this point can be a building block for contributing. You
can ask someone in your field of interest if they can help or maybe just look
for some content online.</p>
<p>So, at this stage it‚Äôs also interesting to take part in events like hackathons,
as you can get an overview of the contribution process for a particular project
in your field of interest.</p>
<p>I, for example, wasn‚Äôt so thrilled about the Linux Kernel before I actually
went to a hackathon focusing on it, and then I saw there‚Äôs just so much to do!
It gives me that ‚Äúrush‚Äù of solving problems with real hardware, and dealing
directly with those things I always found so cool about computers, plus there‚Äôs
an awesome, gigantic, open community, and I think this is super amazing if
you‚Äôre trying to get started :).</p>
<h2 id="on-sending-a-pr">On sending a ‚ÄúPR‚Äù<a class="zola-anchor" href="#on-sending-a-pr" aria-label="Anchor link for: on-sending-a-pr">‚åó</a></h2>
<p>If you aren‚Äôt used to Git(hub|lab)land speak you might have no idea what I‚Äôm
talking about, so let me clarify a bit.</p>
<p>There are basically <strong>two</strong> main ways of contributing to projects, whether
they‚Äôre open-source or not:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are the mailing lists, which I‚Äôve talked about in the
<a href="/on-contributing-to-the-kernel/">previous post</a> (check it out if you haven‚Äôt
already!).</li>
<li>Then there are the <strong>PR</strong>s (that‚Äôs short for <em>pull request</em>). This is the most
common way of contributing to open-source nowadays, you basically take the
project you want to contribute from some point of interest and then add your
code on top, on another version of the project which is basically its copy
(we call that a <em>fork</em>), and when you‚Äôre done you can open a PR so that
contributors can review your code and possibly accept it.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, in this post I‚Äôll talk a little more about sending PRs. This is pretty
straightforward to be honest, specially when compared to the mailing lists.
There are a few ways this can happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Say, you might be using a program, and then you notice it behaves strange for
some inputs, or maybe it often crashes on your system, and you know that‚Äôs
open-source, so you can open an <em>issue</em> (and that‚Äôs another cool thing from
the Git* websites), now this might lead you up a discussion where you think
you can actually solve the issue, or maybe just complement documentation,
which means it‚Äôs PR time!</li>
<li>Another thing that might happen is you‚Äôre working in a project with some
friends/colleagues, and they prefer that mode of contribution, as it might be
preferable to having a lot of people committing changes directly to the main
tree.</li>
<li>Or you can even take a random issue from a project you like and give that a
try! That‚Äôs really cool too!</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Something that‚Äôs really important, though, is to always try and be polite
with the people you‚Äôre dealing in these projects, as they can (and do) often
get stressed out from bad interactions, or just want to be as straightforward
as possible in their ways in order to be efficient ‚Äì remember that this may
be their job, or it may not! You don‚Äôt really know what they‚Äôre going through
or if they even have the time to look at your code‚Ä¶</p>
<p>If you want an insider look into this issue check out
<a href="https://snarky.ca/the-social-contract-of-open-source/">Brett Cannon‚Äôs post/talk on this very subject</a>.</p>

<h3 id="contribution-example">Contribution example<a class="zola-anchor" href="#contribution-example" aria-label="Anchor link for: contribution-example">‚åó</a></h3>
<p>Now, in practice, this might be a little more involved, so I‚Äôll try to
illustrate a personal example:</p>
<hr />
<p>My mentor co-created a
<a href="https://github.com/kworkflow/kworkflow">really cool project</a>
that helps in kernel development workflow (thus ‚ÄúKWorkflow‚Äù, or ‚Äúkw‚Äù for the
intimate), with all sorts of tools. So as I‚Äôm getting started on that he
suggested that I had a look at his project and tried adopting it in my daily
hacking. But then I use a different shell than Linux‚Äôs ‚Äúusual‚Äù (I use fish
btw), and kw isn‚Äôt really meant to be used that way, so I ended up having some
weird problems. Long story short, I opened
<a href="https://github.com/kworkflow/kworkflow/issues/473">an issue</a>
about it, and that‚Äôs <strong>really</strong> simple! Just click on that button in the
‚Äúissues‚Äù tab and voil√†!</p>
<p><img src="/kernel-contrib/new_issue.png" alt="new_issue.png" /></p>
<p>Then, shortly after, I tried having my hand at a first contribution to the
project!</p>
<p>So, I pinpointed a potential source for the problem with my mentor‚Äôs help ‚Äì
which isn‚Äôt documented, unfortunately, but check out
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python/issues/15969">this example</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/hrkfdn/ncspot/issues/579">this one</a> to see how it might go
about :). Next thing you do is fix the problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>git clone</code> the repo, of course</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>check for some <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> file, or if there are any guidelines for
contribution, that might help you a lot!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then you might find out that‚Äôs a single line fix, or maybe you need a whole
new file to support whatever you need! Whatever you find appropriate :) just
go on with it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now you should probably change your working branch to something more in line
with the work you‚Äôre doing:</p>
<p>Maybe call it <code>hotfix-issue-name</code>, or something like that.</p>
<p>Just in case you don‚Äôt know, to change branches you do <code>git checkout [branch-name]</code>, if you‚Äôre creating a new branch you have to use the <code>-b</code>
flag as well (<code>git checkout -b [branch-name]</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before you commit anything, try to have a look at the project‚Äôs <code>git log</code> to
check out for any patterns ‚Äì if the project is big there‚Äôs a good chance
they do something, and it may be similar to the Linux kernel‚Äôs way even!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now you can commit your changes!</p>
<p><code>git add [files-I-changed]</code></p>
<p><code>git commit</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then you fork the project!</p>
<p><img src="/kernel-contrib/fork.png" alt="fork.png" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now add your personal remote, as that‚Äôs where you‚Äôll be pushing your commits
to:</p>
<p><code>git remote add [remote-name] [link-of-your-fork]</code></p>
<p>PS: The remote name is up to you, just don‚Äôt use <code>origin</code> as that‚Äôs probably being used by the original remote.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then push changes (to your remote of course!!!!!!)</p>
<p><code>git push [remote-name] [branch-name]</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now you can open your PR</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately every Git* website will have its own flavour to this process,
but it‚Äôs pretty straight forward, actually :)</p>
<p>Also, don‚Äôt PR Linux, your contribution will be politely <em>ignored</em> if you do
that!</p>
<p><img src="/kernel-contrib/open-PR-github.png" alt="open-PR-github.png" /></p>
<p>Congrats!!!!!!! You‚Äôve made it :D I‚Äôm so proud üò≠</p>
<p>Well, you didn‚Äôt make it just yet, actually! Have a look at my
<a href="https://github.com/kworkflow/kworkflow/pull/474">example‚Äôs PR</a>.
That‚Äôs a lot of corrections they asked‚Ä¶ So now you gotta keep up with
maintainers‚Äô requests! Be sure to check out how to
<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History">rebase interactively</a>
(also
<a href="https://thoughtbot.com/blog/git-interactive-rebase-squash-amend-rewriting-history">check this out</a>)
and force pushes (just <code>git push [remote-name] [branch-name] -f</code>)!</p>
<p>As per Brett‚Äôs talk you know that people might be busy (and that includes
you!). So noone‚Äôs expecting you to be there 24/7 replying to requests and
updating your PR in real time‚Ä¶ Just don‚Äôt forget about it (and be polite!) :)</p>
